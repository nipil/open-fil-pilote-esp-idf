# install

Install recommended extension : "thinker.mock-server" from store

# run

Command palette:
- Mock server : run server
- Mock server : home page
- change URL to /ofp.html


# modify

when modifying route contents, the extension watches and content should be available without restart

when adding or modifying routes, the server should be restarted (command palette, reset and restart)

# warning

it seems you cannot use a /api/* route

it seems you get the embedded home UI only when the staticDir (aka ../components/ofp-webserver here) is not present
